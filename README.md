🚀 Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate the working of popular sorting algorithms in a dynamic and animated way.

This project was developed as part of the Data Structures coursework to enhance conceptual understanding through visualization.

📌 Features

📊 Real-time visualization of sorting processes

🎞️ Smooth animations for better understanding

⚡ Adjustable array size

🎛️ Speed control for sorting animations

🎨 Clean and user-friendly UI

🧠 Algorithms Implemented

🔵 Bubble Sort

🟢 Insertion Sort

🟡 Merge Sort

🔴 Quick Sort

Each algorithm is implemented from scratch in JavaScript and visualized using DOM manipulation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling & Layout

JavaScript – Algorithm logic & DOM manipulation

📷 How It Works

Generate a random array.

Select a sorting algorithm.

Watch the algorithm sort step-by-step in real-time.

Observe comparisons, swaps, and recursive behavior (for Merge & Quick Sort).

This helps in understanding:

Time Complexity

Space Complexity

Internal working of sorting algorithms

📚 Learning Outcomes

Strengthened understanding of sorting techniques

Improved JavaScript logic building

Hands-on experience with DOM manipulation

Visual representation of algorithm flow

🚀 How to Run Locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git
cd algorithm-visualizer
open index.html


Or simply open index.html in your browser.

📈 Future Improvements

Add Heap Sort

Add Selection Sort

Add Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)

Add complexity comparison chart

Add sound effects for swaps
